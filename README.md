Kitchissippi02
==============

An open source CoreXY based 3D Printer conceived, designed and built in Kitchissippi, a district of Ottawa, Canada.
It is my second printer design, the first being incomplete in favour of this one.

The basic design uses common hardware store 3/4" square aluminum tubing and #8-32 nuts and bolts. There is a bit of a mix involved however. NEMA17 motors use M3 hardare, as do the related filament drive pulleys.
I would prefer to use metric exclusively, however the hardware is scare to find in the average store here, despite the official measurement system.

As of this writing (November 1st, 2013) I expect a lot of revisions to this design - print and build at your own risk!
